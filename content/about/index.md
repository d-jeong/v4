Hello! I'm David, a software engineer based in New York City.

I love creating iOS apps that are beautiful and fun to use. In my free time, you can find me at a basketball court or in the middle of a Super Smash Bros. Melee match.

Upon graduating from [Harvard University](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science), I joined the iOS team at [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/espn/apps/espn), where I had the chance to begin my career with meaningful projects that would impact sports fans worldwide. Soon afterwards, I found myself at [Barstool Sports](https://www.barstoolsports.com/), where I delivered new features for numerous apps on a daily basis. Currently, I'm an iOS Engineer on the Rider Spots team at [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/), making sure that you can get to your destination!

Here are some of the skills I have learned along the way:
